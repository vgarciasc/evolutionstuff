# evolutionstuff

## What is it?

A repo containing implementations of some evolutionary algorithms, mostly inspired by Daniel Shiffman's lessons ([Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com), [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com)).

## Show me the shiny stuff!

- [Boids](https://vgarciasc.github.io/evolutionstuff/boids/)
  - Simple sketch I made to understand p5.js.
  - Based on chapter 6 of [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/).
- [Cellular automata](https://vgarciasc.github.io/evolutionstuff/ca/)
  - Random generation of elementary CAs.
  - Based on chapter 7 of [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/).
- [Neuroevolution in Flappy Bird](https://vgarciasc.github.io/evolutionstuff/flappy-bird/neuroevolution/)
  - Watch the evolution of a neural network capable of playing Flappy Bird!
  - Based on a coding challenge of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6y21FkaUqw)
- [Monte Carlo Tree Search in Tic-Tac-Toe](https://vgarciasc.github.io/evolutionstuff/mcts/)
  - Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a MCTS-based algorithm!
